### App Idea: *MoodTunes*

MoodTunes is a music and journaling app that helps users track their emotions and discover music that matches or improves their mood. Each day, users can log how they’re feeling using a mood tracker and write a short journal entry. It’s designed to be a fun and reflective tool for emotional self-care through music.

## Notes

Had trouble finding where the buttons, labels, and files are.
